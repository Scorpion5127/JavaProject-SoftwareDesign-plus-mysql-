# Geometric Shapes Codebase with MySQL Integration

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of an object-oriented codebase for geometric shapes, focusing on modularity, efficiency, and robust functionality. It integrates Java programming with MySQL for data management, creating a comprehensive application for geometric processing and visualization.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes class hierarchies, abstract classes, and interfaces to ensure a clean, modular, and extensible codebase.
- **Shape Calculations and Comparisons**: Includes methods for performing geometric calculations, comparing shapes, and handling advanced shape-processing operations.
- **Visualization**: Facilitates the visualization of shapes, enhancing usability and providing a better understanding of geometric properties.
- **Database Integration**: 
  - Designed an Entity-Relationship (ER) model and implemented a database schema using MySQL Server.
  - Seamlessly connected the Java application to the MySQL database for efficient data storage and management.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL Server
- **Design Principles**: Object-oriented programming (OOP)

## How to Use
1. **Setup the Database**:
   - Import the provided SQL script to set up the MySQL database schema.
   - Update database connection details in the Java application as needed.

2. **Run the Application**:
   - Compile and run the Java application to perform geometric operations and visualize results.

3. **Extend the Codebase**:
   - Add new shapes or operations by extending the existing class hierarchy or implementing new interfaces.

## Benefits
- **Code Reusability**: The modular design ensures that the codebase can be easily expanded for new functionalities.
- **Efficiency**: Integration with MySQL enables smooth and efficient data handling.
- **Flexibility**: Abstract classes and interfaces allow for adaptability and extension without significant refactoring.
